## Building ##
You will need the following dependencies to build DRNSF:

 * CMake >= 3.12
 * PkgConfig
 * Python 3 >= 3.2
 * libepoxy _(recommended >= 1.3.1)_
 * Cairo _(recommended >= 1.14.12)_
 * C++17 compiler and toolset; specifically supported are:
   * GCC >= 7.4.0
   * Visual Studio 2017 _(requires "Desktop development with C++")_

If you are using __Ubuntu 18.10__ or __Debian Buster__, you can install
these dependencies with:
```sh
$ sudo apt install build-essential git cmake pkg-config libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libepoxy-dev libcairo2-dev
```

Depending on your selected frontend and features, you may need more
dependencies. See `docs/build_options.md` for more details.

Building is done using cmake. This should be done out-of-tree. The
`build/` directory is reserved in `.gitignore` for this purpose so it
will not be included in git commits.

Retrieving and building drnsf can be done like so:

```sh
/$ git clone https://github.com/cbhacks/drnsf
/$ cd drnsf
/drnsf$ mkdir build
/drnsf$ cd build
/drnsf/build$ cmake ..
/drnsf/build$ make
/drnsf/build$ make test #if desired
```

## Installing ##
At this time, DRNSF is not intended to be installed to any system
directories.
