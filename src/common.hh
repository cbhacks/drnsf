/*
 * DRNSF_ON_EXIT
 *
 * This macro can be used within a code block to provide code which will run
 * when that code block exits, whether by a statement such as `return' or
 * `break', or by a thrown exception. Example usage:
 *
 *   FILE *f = fopen("config.txt", "r");
 *   if (!f) { exit(1); }
 *   DRNSF_ON_EXIT { fclose(f); };
 *   }
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   return 0;
 *
 * These error handlers can also be stacked, for example:
 *
 *   int err = SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
 *   if (err < 0) { ... }
 *   DRNSF_ON_EXIT { SDL_Quit(); };
 *
 *   auto wnd = SDL_CreateWindow(...);
 *   if (!wnd) { ... }
 *   DRNSF_ON_EXIT { SDL_DestroyWindow(wnd); };
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   return 0;
 *
 * Using DRNSF_ON_EXIT is often more reliable than placing cleanup code after a
 * code block because DRNSF_ON_EXIT blocks will execute even if the block exit
 * is due to an exception being thrown. For example:
 *
 *   CURL *c = curl_easy_init();
 *   if (!c) { ... }
 *
 *   ... some code which may throw an exception ...
 *
 *   curl_easy_cleanup(c);
 *
 * In this case, if the intervening code throws an exception, curl_easy_cleanup
 * is not called, which results in a resource leak. Using DRNSF_ON_EXIT:
 *
 *   CURL *c = curl_easy_init();
 *   if (!c) { ... }
 *   DRNSF_ON_EXIT { curl_easy_cleanup(c); };
 *
 *   ... some code which may throw an exception ...
 *
 * In this case, even if the code throws an exception, the curl object will be
 * released properly.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Because the body of a DRNSF_ON_EXIT statement may execute as part
 * of exception unwinding, the body code MUST NOT throw an exception itself. It
 * is acceptable for an exception to be thrown within execution of the body,
 * however it must also be caught within the body and not allowed to escape.
