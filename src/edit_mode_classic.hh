 * edit_mode_classic.hh
 *
 * The "Classic" editor mode.
 *
 * This file and its associated implementation source files provide an editor
 * mode designed to somewhat mimic the data model presented to the user by the
 * CrashEdit software, another editor developed prior to DRNSF.
 *
 * This mode provides a split view, with a treeview on the left-hand side
 * allowing the user to select an asset, and a more in-depth view containing
 * details of the selected asset on the right-hand side. This is very similar
 * to the Assets mode, however the tree is structured in a fundamentally
 * different manner.
 *
 * The tree displays a single "NSF" asset named "/nsfile", that archive's pages
 * (assuming it is an archive) as its only children, and the entries contained
 * within those pages as their respective children.
 *
 * An example tree is shown here, although the node text may not be accurate:
 *
 *  [-] NSF
 *   |--- [-] Page #0
 *   |     |--- [-] Pagelet #0 - ABC_Z (entry)
 *   |     |--- [-] Pagelet #1 - ABC_S (entry)
 *   |     |--- [-] Pagelet #2 - XYZ_A (entry)
 *   |     \--- [-] Pagelet #3 - 123_M (entry)
 *   |--- [-] Page #1
 *   |     |--- [-] Pagelet #0 - 001gZ (entry)
 *   |     \--- [-] Pagelet #1 - 002gZ (entry)
 *   |--- [+] Page #2
 *   |--- [+] Page #3
 *   |
 *    ...
 *
 * This tree faces some complications not present in CrashEdit:
 *
 *  1. Some objects in the tree may not exist. For example, if the NSF "pages"
 *  list contains an asset name which is not in use. In this case, the object
 *  title is usually displayed as "Nothing".
 *
 *  2. Some objects in the tree may be null references. For example, if a page
 *  "pagelets" list contains a null reference. In this case, the object title
 *  is usually displayed as "Nothing".
 *
 *  3. Some objects in the tree may not have the expected type for their role
 *  within the tree. For example, an entry asset could be referenced directly
 *  by the "pages" list of the NSF, or a "pagelets" element could reference a
 *  non-entry asset such as `gfx::model'. In this case, the object title is
 *  usually displayed as "Incompatible Asset".
 *
 *  4. Some objects in the tree may appear multiple times. For example, an
 *  entry asset could be referenced by multiple pages. In this case, both
 *  nodes in the tree appear independent of eachother, but the editor will
 *  still be displaying and modifying the same asset regardless of which one
 *  is selected.
 *
 * DRNSF will not normally load an NSF file into a state where any of these
 * cases occurs, and most of these scenarios will likely result in a project
 * which cannot be saved to an NSF file again as the structure would be totally
 * incompatible with the NSF file format. Regardless, all of these are valid
 * project configurations in DRNSF, so the editor supports them.
 *
 * Currently, the only difference in this editor as compared to the Assets
 * editor is the tree layout. No differences apply to the asset details view.
 * This will likely change in the future, as the kinds of operations applied in
 * this model (as in CrashEdit) are often different. For example, deleting an
 * entry requires not only deleting the asset, but also some of its referenced
 * assets as well as removing the reference to that asset from its containing
 * page.
